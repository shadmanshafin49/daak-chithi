Almost a clone of **NGL** and **Chithi.me**.

Currently, it only runs on the **Expo Go app** :(.

### What you can do so far:

* Create an account :(
* Share your public link (currently only works locally) :(
* Check your inbox
* Share your address by copying the link
* Receive anonymous messages from others and read them
* Save messages as images (idky)
* Logout

### Known issues:

* Runs on a local server only (no production server yet)
* bad ui
