# Daak Chithi App

Almost a clone of **NGL** and **Chithi.me**.

Currently, it only runs on the **Expo Go app** :(.

### What you can do so far:

* Create an account :(
* Share your public link (currently only works locally) :(
* Check your inbox
* Share your address by copying the link
* Receive anonymous messages from others and read them
* Save messages as images (not sure why, but hey, itâ€™s there!)
* Logout

---

### Known issues:

* Runs on a local server only (no production server yet)
* UI needs a serious glow-up â€” itâ€™s rough around the edges
* Settings screen is almost empty (only has logout)
* And many more bugs and quirks \:D

Thatâ€™s the current state of things! More improvements coming soon ðŸš€
